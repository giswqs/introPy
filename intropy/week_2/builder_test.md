# Test your Builder skills!
By now, you should be able to create a simple experiment using the PsychoPy Builder interface! In the tutorials, we guided you through the process of building a Builder experiment from beginning to end. If you want to test your skills, try to recreate the Lexican Decision Task 

<a href="https://run.pavlovia.org/demos/lexical-decision-task/html/" class="btn btn-primary" style="color:white;">Start the Lexical Decision Task
</a>

Try to include the following:

* A dialog box asked for the participant ID and age of the participant
  * Note: you don't have to recreate the "Field marked with an asterisk (*) are required" text
* A welcome screen with text
* An instruction screen, which continues upon a button press by the participant
* A loop with trials including a fixation target, the stimulus, and feedback (text showing "correct", "incorrect", or "missed")
  * Create the stimuli (real words, fake words) yourself
  * Make sure that the trial conditions (real word, fake word) are presented randomly
* A "goodbye" screen, thanking the participant for their contribution
